# GLSL

Learning glsl for shading purposes. In my case will use this knowledge combined with three.js to create beatiful, usefull, and novative 3D webapps.
For now i'll only use two ressources in order to learn:

Lewis Lepton channel: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4neAtv21WOmIrTrkNO3xCyrxg4LKkrF7

The Book of Shaders by Patricio Gonzalez Vivo & Jen Lowe: https://thebookofshaders.com/


I'll add results of the sahders i'll be creating on this readme, so averyone can watch and pick the shader they want.
